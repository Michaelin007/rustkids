Did you know that all computer programs works with data of one kind or other. The data may be numbers,dates, text, pictures e.t.c

To use the mentioned data in our program, we need to store them. 

Variables are used to store data needed in our program. They can be changed i.e mutable and they may not be changed i.e immutable.

fn main() {
    //example of variables

    //A variable holding integer
    let x = 1;
    //A varible holding string
    let y = "one";
    //A variable holding boolean
    let ass= true;
println!("Hello World");
