# Module 1

### A Nice Conversation

Ada: I think there is a way one can talk to computer the same way we communicate.

Phillip: Really ! How ?

Ada: Programming !!! I wanna learn it.

Phillip: me too 

Ada: Okay, cool. Let's meet Rust and I guess it can put us through.

### Basic Terms

Vocabulary
Hey kids, you may not understand all this at first, that’s OK! We’ll see examples of them throughout the class.

* What is programming: It’s the process of designing and building a program using a computer to solve a specific problem.

* Program: A specific sequence of instructions that precisely instruct a computer to do something. All software consists of one or more programs.

* Programs are normal files on your computer, just like anything else. The only difference between a program file and other files is that a program file can be turned into a process.

* Process: A single instance of a running program on your computer.

* Programming language: A set of instructions with which to write a program. Source code is made up of these instructions, and the specific way in which one writes the instructions is called the programming language’s syntax.

* Text editor: A program that one uses to manipulate the source code for a program.

* Shell: A tool for issuing commands directly to computer.

Getting Started with RUST. Rust is a programming language developed at mozilla. We can use the language to instruct the computer on what to do.

Writing our first program:
How do you say hello to your friends ? You just say hello right ? Every programmer first program is always “hello-world”. We have to greet the world first.
 Writing hello world in Rust:
 ```rust,editable
fn main() {
printlin!("Hello World");
}
```


Now change the code to say hello to one of your friends. Congratulations you have just instructed the computer to greet your friend.
